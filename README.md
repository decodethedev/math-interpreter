# Math-Interpreter
This is a math 'interpreter' I just made today, it can calculates complex maths. I am working to add more supports and make this into a gui in the future!
Also I am learning lexer so I made this calculator using this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh49BXmHxX8
I also made configs inside configs.py

[ + ] Added configs.py

[ + ] Support for [] (Square brackets)

[ + ] Support for <> (Curly brackets)

[ + ] Support for decimal syntax such as .10 change to 0.10 or 1. to 1.0

To use this simply run main.py and then give it some maths!
